# Privacy Policy

Last Updated: January 16, 2025

## Introduction
This comprehensive privacy policy outlines the data handling practices of our browser extension. At its core, our extension operates with a fundamental commitment to user privacy and data protection. We have designed our extension to function without collecting, storing, or transmitting any user data whatsoever. This document provides a detailed explanation of our privacy-first approach to browser extension development and operation.

## Data Collection and Storage Practices
Our extension adheres to strict privacy-preserving principles by implementing a zero-data-collection policy. We have intentionally designed the extension to operate entirely within your browser session, without any mechanisms for collecting, storing, or transmitting personal data, browsing history, or usage statistics. The extension does not employ cookies, tracking mechanisms, or any form of user identification systems. This commitment to privacy extends across all aspects of the extension's functionality, ensuring that your browsing activities remain completely private and under your control at all times.

## Operational Methodology
The extension's functionality is confined entirely to your browser's local environment. When you visit any of our supported news websites, the extension performs all its operations locally within your browser session. This process involves checking whether you're on a supported website and processing the current webpage's content entirely within your browser's environment. Any data accessed during this process remains strictly within the confines of your browser session and is automatically discarded when you navigate away from the page, leaving no persistent data trail.

## Local Storage and User Preferences
The sole exception to our zero-storage policy relates to user preferences, specifically which supported websites you want the extension to be active on. These preferences are stored locally in your browser using chrome.storage.sync, which is a secure, browser-provided storage mechanism. This minimal storage is essential for maintaining your chosen settings between browsing sessions and exists solely to enhance your user experience. No other information is stored, and these preferences remain under your complete control, being easily modifiable or deletable at any time through the extension's settings interface.

## Third-Party Interactions and External Services
Our extension maintains complete independence from external services and third-party interactions. We have deliberately designed the extension to operate without any connections to external servers, analytics services, or tracking mechanisms. This isolation ensures that your browsing activity remains private and that no data leaves your browser environment. The extension does not integrate with any third-party services, analytics platforms, or tracking systems, maintaining a completely self-contained operational environment.

## Policy Updates and Version Control
We maintain transparency regarding any changes to our privacy practices through this policy document. The date at the top of this document indicates its last update, and any modifications to our privacy practices will be reflected here with an updated timestamp. While we are committed to maintaining our zero-data-collection approach, we will notify users of any policy changes that might affect how the extension operates with respect to privacy and data handling.

## User Rights and Control
Given our zero-data-collection policy, there is no personal information for users to access, modify, or delete. Your interaction with the extension remains completely private, and you maintain full control over your experience. The only action available regarding data management is the ability to uninstall the extension, which will remove your stored preferences. This straightforward approach ensures that you have complete control over your privacy at all times.

## Transparency and Verification
Our commitment to privacy is verifiable through our open-source codebase, which is publicly available on GitHub. We encourage users to review our code to verify our privacy practices and ensure that the extension operates as described in this policy. This transparency demonstrates our dedication to maintaining user trust and privacy while providing a useful service that respects your fundamental right to privacy online.

## Contact and Support
For any questions, concerns, or clarifications about this privacy policy or our privacy practices, we encourage users to open an issue on our GitHub repository. We are committed to maintaining open communication with our users and addressing any privacy-related concerns promptly and transparently.

This privacy policy reflects our unwavering commitment to user privacy and data protection. By maintaining a zero-data-collection approach and operating entirely within the browser environment, we ensure that your privacy remains protected while using our extension.
